# SQL-and-SQOOP-Data-Ingestion-ETL-main
# Technologies Big Data

# Problem Statement:
Use Sqoop to read data from SQL database and import it into Hadoop.
You need to build the following requirement:
1. Create SQL database at any cloud platform.
2. Design an Ecommerce database and store 10 GB record in SQL Database.
3. Use Sqoop to load data from SQL Database to Hadoop.
4. Schedule pipeline such a way that new data from Database can be transferred to
Hadoop automatically on daily basis.

# Dataset:
Design dataset as per your choice.

# Project Evaluation metrics:
# Code:
● You are supposed to write a code in a modular fashion
● Safe: It can be used without causing harm.
● Testable: It can be tested at the code level.
● Maintainable: It can be maintained, even as your codebase grows.
● Portable: It works the same in every environment (operating system)
● You have to maintain your code on GitHub.
● You have to keep your GitHub repo public so that anyone can check your code.
● Proper readme file you have to maintain for any project development.
● You should include basic workflow and execution of the entire project in the
readme file on GitHub
● Follow the coding standards: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/

# Cloud:
● You can use any cloud platform for this entire solution hosting like AWS, Azure
or GCP

# API Details or User Interface:
● You have to expose your complete solution as an API or try to create a user
interface for your model testing. Anything will be fine for us.

# Logging:
● Logging is a must for every action performed by your code use the python
logging library for this.

# Ops Pipeline:
● If possible, you can try to use AI ops pipeline for project delivery Ex. DVC,
MLflow , Sagemaker , Azure machine learning studio, Jenkins, Circle CI, Azure
DevOps , TFX, Travis CI

# Deployment:
● You can host your model in the cloud platform, edge devices, or maybe local,
but with a proper justification of your system design.

# Solutions Design:
● You have to submit complete solution design strategies in HLD and LLD
document

# System Architecture:
● You have to submit a system architecture design in your wireframe document
and architecture document.

# Latency for model response:
● You have to measure the response time of your model for a particular input of a
dataset.

# Optimization of solutions:
● Try to optimize your solution on code level, architecture level and mention all of
these things in your final submission.
● Mention your test cases for your project.
